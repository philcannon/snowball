# Snowball Run - Game Design Document

## Core Gameplay
- Control a growing/shrinking snowball in a side-scrolling winter landscape
- Primary goal: Survive as long as possible while collecting snow and avoiding obstacles
- Character automatically moves right with increasing speed over time

## Controls
- W: Move up
- A: Move left (slight resistance against auto-scroll)
- S: Move down
- D: Move right (increases speed temporarily)
- Spacebar: Jump over water streams
- Jump height/distance scales with snowball size

## Snowball Mechanics
- Starting size: Equivalent to 3 small snowballs
- Maximum size: Equivalent to 20 small snowballs
- Minimum size: 1 snowball (game over if reduced below this)
- Movement speed slightly decreases as size increases
- Larger snowballs can break through certain obstacles
- Visual feedback: Snowball size changes visually as it grows/shrinks

## Obstacles & Collectibles
### Small Snowballs (Collectibles)
- Scattered across the ground
- Each adds +1 to snowball size
- Brief sparkle animation when collected
- Collection sound effect

### Fire Hazards
- Various sizes of campfires and torches
- Contact reduces snowball size by 2
- Visual steam effect when hit
- Warning symbols appear before fires

### Water Streams
- Variable widths (1-3 snowball lengths)
- Must be jumped over
- Falling in results in immediate game over
- Visual ripple effects
- Audio cue when approaching

## Environment
- Procedurally generated winter landscape
